## Component Placement Order
- Place components in the following order:
  1. Resistor
  2. Capacitor
  3. Microcontroller

## Wiring Sequence
- Follow this sequence:
  1. Ground connections first.
  2. Power connections second.
  3. Data connections last.

## Initial Testing After Each Major Component
- Test functionality as components are added:
  - Check microcontroller responses.
  - Measure voltage across components.

## Troubleshooting Common Assembly Issues
1. No power - Check power connections.
2. Component not detected - Verify wiring.
3. Overheating - Inspect solder joints and component ratings.

## Final Inspection Checklist
- All components double-checked.
- No loose wires.
- Solder joints inspected for cold solder.

## First Power-On Procedure
- Connect power source.
- Monitor for any irregular sounds or smells.

## Smoke Test Procedures
- Conduct a smoke test by powering on while monitoring for smoke.
- If smoke detected, immediately power down and troubleshoot.
